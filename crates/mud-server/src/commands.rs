//! Player command system: registry-driven, role/permission gated.
//!
//! Every command is a `Command` value in the `COMMANDS` slice. Adding a new
//! command means appending one entry — names, role, perm, category, help, and
//! a handler `fn(&mut World, Entity, &str)`. Help is a required field; the
//! registry's first-touch initialization asserts on empty `help.summary` and
//! on duplicate names so contract violations surface at server startup, not
//! when a player tries to use the command.
